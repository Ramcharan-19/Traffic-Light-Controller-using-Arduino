# 🚦 Traffic Light Controller Using Arduino

## 📖 Overview
The **Traffic Light Controller** is an Arduino-based project designed to simulate a real-world traffic signal system. This project uses an **Arduino microcontroller**, **LEDs**, and a **timing mechanism** to regulate the flow of traffic efficiently. It can be expanded for real-time implementation in smart traffic management systems.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Simulate a real-world traffic signal system.
- Understand and apply **Arduino programming** concepts.
- Learn how to control **LEDs and timing sequences**.
- Improve traffic flow and safety using automation.

## 🛠️ Components Required
- 🟢 **Arduino Uno**
- 🔴 **Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs**
- ⚡ **Resistors (220Ω)**
- 🔌 **Breadboard & Jumper Wires**
- 🔄 **Push Button (for pedestrian crossing feature, optional)**

## 🔬 Working Principle
1. **Green Light ON (5 sec)** – Vehicles can move forward.
2. **Yellow Light ON (2 sec)** – Indicates caution before stopping.
3. **Red Light ON (5 sec)** – Vehicles must stop.
4. The cycle repeats continuously.

## 🚀 Features & Future Enhancements
✅ **Basic Traffic Light Control** – Manages standard signal timing.
✅ **Pedestrian Crossing** – Can be implemented using push buttons.
✅ **Sensor-Based Control** – Detects vehicles and adjusts timing dynamically.
✅ **Integration with IoT** – Can be upgraded for smart traffic management.
